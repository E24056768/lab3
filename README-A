  At first,I use a class(ifstream) to read some information of a file.I inFile

  in a number n which represent the number of cows.Then I set up an initial
 
  array of size n to store the weight of all the cows.Then I assign the 

  information of an array to a vector(v) of size n.The next,I use the sort 

  function to sort all the element of the vector.After finishing sorting,I

  sum up the top five cows and print out the sum of their weight.
